      "description": "The Sydney Speaks Collection brings together three sub-corpora of recorded spontaneous speech: Sydney Speaks 2010s, Sydney Social Dialect Survey, and NSW Bicentennial Oral History Collection. The Sydney Speaks 2010s Corpus speakers include a cross-section of Sydney's residents, consisting of recordings from older and younger adult males and females who are of varied socio-economic status, region within Sydney, and ethnic community. Participants are Anglo Australians whose parents and grandparents were born in Australia, and 2nd generation Australians of different ethnic communities.  Data was collected via sociolinguistic interviews, conducted by community Research Assistants with their extended network, providing long samples of natural speech for analysis and, at the same time, detailed information about participantsâ€™ demographic profile, their sociolinguistic history and their social network. The Sydney Social Dialect Survey was compiled by Barbara Horvath between 1977 and 1980. The corpus comprises 177 sociolinguistic interviews, with adult and teenage Australians of Anglo, Greek and Italian descent (including 1st and 2nd generation), stratified according to gender and socio-economic status. In the 120 hours of recorded speech, among other topics, participants talk about schooling, childhood games, and attitudes to Australian English.  The NSW Bicentennial Oral History Collection was produced in 1988 by the NSW Bicentennial Oral History Project, funded by a bicentennial grant to the NSW Council on the Ageing and the Oral History Association of Australia (NSW). The Collection includes two hundred recorded interviews with men and women born before 1910 who lived in NSW between 1900 and 1930. The interviews focus on everyday life in the early 20th Century, and speakers talk about topics such as education, health, employment, religion and courtship. The collection is available online via the State Library of NSW and the National Library of Australia. We thank the National Library of Australia for granting us extended access to this collection.",
